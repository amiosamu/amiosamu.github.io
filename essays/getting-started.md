# Getting Started

Welcome! This blog supports full Markdown formatting, making it easy to write and publish essays.

## Writing Essays

All essays are stored in the `essays/` directory as `.md` or `.mdx` files. Each essay should have frontmatter at the top:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Essay Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
description: "A brief description of your essay"
---

Your content here...
```

## Markdown Support

You can use all standard Markdown features including:

1. Headers (H1-H6)
2. Lists (ordered and unordered)
3. Links and images
4. Code blocks with syntax highlighting
5. Blockquotes
6. And more!

## Publishing

Once you've written your essay, simply commit and push to the main branch. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site.

Happy writing!
